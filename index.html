            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
                I am a 22-year-old currently studying my second year at The University of Auckland. I am studying my Bachelor
                of Science majoring in Computer Science. I take into account all possibilities and factors of situations
                resulting in the highest quality of outcomes, always striving for excellence in all things. As I think that
                if something needs to be done it should be done at the highest grade.

            <h2>Music Web Application</h2>
            <p>
                I created this Music Web Application with a partner. We designed and built a Web application that lets users
                interact with a collection of soundtracks. We started with creating our domain model, turning it into a web application
                by following a series of functional and Non-functional requirements for our web application. Finally, we extended the
                application such that instead of a memory repository, it uses a SQLite database to persist data.<br>

            <h2>Bouncing Program</h2>
            <p>
                The Bouncing Program is a Java program which animates user selected shapes bouncing off the screem. This assignment project
                aims to develop and reinforce skills in object-oriented programming. The assignment involves working with design patterns
                and Java's Swing API. I was required to complete and extend the application in a way that makes appropriate use of design
                principles and patterns. The Bouncing Program is a model/view application that presents two views of a list of bouncing
                shapes in the program. Such applications are commonplace and introduce the need for views to be mutually consistent and
                synchronised with a data structure whose state changes at run-time. <br>
